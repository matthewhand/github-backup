Notebook Analysis

Here is a summary of the analysis of the notebooks in the project:

1. 'CombineCloudFormationResources (1).ipynb': This notebook contains code for defining CloudFormation resources related to the 'GithubBackupPipelineRole', an IAM Role with permissions for Amazon S3, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS Lambda.

2. 'CombineCloudFormationResources.ipynb': This notebook does not contain any executed code cells. It seems like this notebook was created but not used.

3. 'GenerateCloudFormationTemplate.ipynb': This notebook is used for generating a CloudFormation template for an EC2 instance, writing it to a file, and then uploading that file to an S3 bucket. The code cells have not been executed in this notebook.

4. 'Github_Module_Installation (1).ipynb' and 'Github_Module_Installation.ipynb': These notebooks are identical and are used for installing the 'genai' and 'PyGithub' Python packages, loading the 'genai' extension, and interacting with the GitHub API to list the contents of the 'notebooks' directory in the 'matthewhand/github-backup' repository. The code cells have not been executed in these notebooks.

5. 'My First Notebook.ipynb': This notebook does not contain any executed code cells.

There is no 'DeployCloudFormationStack.ipynb' notebook in the current directory, contrary to what was expected.
